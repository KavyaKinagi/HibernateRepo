Hibernate(ORM Tool)
-Hibernate will help us in Model(MVC) part
Model is divided into 3 parts:
1)services(Security,Transaction,logger,JNDI,JMS,mailing)
All these services may require for business.
2)business
3)DAO(Data Access Object)

Application server
Weblogic
JBoss
Glassfish

get the services from application server.

JDBC Drawback:
database dependent queries.

daily check in,check out,lunch break of 1 lakh employee in zensar.id scanning for 3 times. with this 3 times database communication. That means 3 lakh times database communication.

To improve application performance,cache is there is hibernate.


To load facebook first time it requires more time than subsequent request.
cache data.


Gavin king developed many features of EJB in Hibernate.
EJB can't run without application server.
Hibernate doesn't require application server.

no dependency with Hibernate.
no need to buy services from application server, just spring is sufficient to provide all services.
