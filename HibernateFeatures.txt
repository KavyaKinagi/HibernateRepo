SQL - dependent queries
HQL - database independent query
3)cache support
  facebook
  to load first time requires x time.
  second time onwards to load the same, requires x-y time
  because it retrieves data from cache and cookies of local   system.

  1 lakh employees daily swipes the card, which requires validation of usreid and password with the help of database.
  during lunch break,teabreak they went outside, so once again communication with database is very expensive.
  So we can use cache memory
4)Primary key generator
  e.g. user registration form for course enquiry,never ask id, because there may be chance of duplicate id.
5)Validation(with the help of Hibernate Annotations)
6)Exception free
